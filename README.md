# odin-landing-page

Hi there! This is my take on the "Landing Page" project from TOP! Hopefully it'll go well...

Version 1 (25/02/22):

Well, I was able to layout most/all of the content for the html page.

Now I'm trying to style it in CSS. I feel pretty good about the header part, moving on to the 2nd section (content).

Not sure yet how to place the "Join!" button underneath the text, but at least I got the image to place on the right side parallel to the text, yay!
