# odin-landing-page

Hi there! This is my take on the "Landing Page" project from TOP! Hopefully it'll go well...

Version 1 (25/02/22):

Well, I was able to layout most/all of the content for the html page.

Now I'm trying to style it in CSS. I feel pretty good about the header part, moving on to the 2nd section (content).

Not sure yet how to place the "Join!" button underneath the text, but at least I got the image to place on the right side parallel to the text, yay!

Version 2 (28/02/22):

So, today I added a bunch of stuff to my HTML and CSS codes in order to make the layout look a lot better (more or less as close as possible to the TOP LP template). It looks pretty good, I probably need to add a few pages for the links to work properly. Might need to revisit some of the MDN documentation for some new concepts that I discovered today. Overall, I feel pretty good about this project.
